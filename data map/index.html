<!-- Considering that Vision Zero was implemented by the DOT in 2014, the fact that there are still nearly 200 fatalities per year and a significant number of serious injuries shows that there is still much work to be done and considerable room for improvement. -->

<h3>Despite the decline in fatalities, nearly 200 New Yorkers still lost their lives in traffic accidents. </h3>

<p>Traffic crashes killed 193 New Yorkers in 2025, representing a 24% decline compared with 2024, when 253 fatalities occurred. On this point, New York City Department of Transportation (NYC DOT) Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said on Tuesday that the agency is celebrating four consecutive years of decline in traffic-related deaths.</p>

<p>Despite this progress, some neighborhoods in the city still experience a high number of traffic fatalities. This year, such cases were concentrated in Woodside, Long Island City, Astoria, and Jackson Heights, the latter being ranked among the lowest in the city for park space per resident.</p> 

<p>Other neighborhoods with significant numbers of traffic deaths include Woodhaven, Kew Gardens, Richmond Hill East, and Richmond Hill in Queens. In Brooklyn, fatalities occurred mainly in East New York, Cypress Hills, Kings Bay, Gravesend, Sheepshead Bay, and Manhattan Beach—all of which have lower park acres per capita than the citywide average, with most having limited open space.</p> 

<p>These neighborhoods are often served by wide arterial roads and fast-moving traffic corridors that cut through or border residential areas, increasing the risk of traffic fatalities.</p>
